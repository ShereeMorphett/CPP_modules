    
Data Persistence: Serialization is commonly used to save the state of an object to a file or a 
                database so that it can be loaded and reconstructed later. 
                For example, you could use this to save game progress, user preferences, 
                or application settings.

Data Transmission: Serialization is essential for transmitting data over a network or between 
                different processes. By serializing data into a common format, 
                you can send it over a network or between systems and then 
                deserialize it at the other end.

Remote Procedure Calls (RPC): When making remote function calls, you may need to send complex 
                            data structures as parameters or return values. Serialization can be 
                            used to package these data structures for transmission and then 
                            deserialize them on the remote end.

Caching: In applications that involve heavy computations, serialization can be used to cache 
        the results of expensive operations. This way, if the same operation is requested again, 
        the result can be quickly retrieved from the cache instead of recomputing it.

Interoperability: Serialization can be used to facilitate interoperability between different 
            programming languages or platforms. By serializing data into a 
            standard format (e.g., JSON or XML), it can be easily exchanged between systems 
            regardless of their programming languages.

Object State Restoration: In cases where you need to recreate objects with a specific state, 
                        serialization and deserialization can be useful. For instance, in 
                        multi-threading or distributed systems, you can save and restore the state 
                        of objects.

In this code, the serialize and deserialize methods demonstrate a basic, 
simple example of serialization. In real-world applications, more complex serialization methods 
are often used, and you need to handle various considerations, such as versioning, security,
 and error handling.
